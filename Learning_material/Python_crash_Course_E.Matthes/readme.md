# \# Python Crash Course – Learning Repository

# 

# This repository documents my progress while studying \*Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)\* by Eric Matthes.  

# Each section contains exercises, experiments, and notes that reflect my understanding of Python fundamentals as I work through the book.

# The goal of this repository is to maintain a clear learning timeline, demonstrate consistent practice, and build a foundation for more advanced Python projects.  

# This is an active learning space, and I will continue updating it as I complete new chapters and explore additional concepts.
