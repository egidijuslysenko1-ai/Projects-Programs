This folder contains small Python programs that I made to calculate basic physics forces.

They are written as learning and practice projects, combining physics formulas with beginner Python programming.

The programs are interactive and allow the user to enter values and immediately see results.

# 1. Coloumb_Force.py
Calculates the electrostatic force between two point charges using Coulomb’s Law
User inputs:

Charge q1 (Coulombs)

Charge q2 (Coulombs)

Distance r between charges (meters)

Output:

Electrostatic force F in Newtons (N)

# 2. Gravitational_Force_NewtonsLaw.py
Calculates the gravitational force between two masses using Newton’s Law of Gravitation:
User inputs:

Mass m1 (kg)

Mass m2 (kg)

Distance r between masses (meters)

Output:

Gravitational force F in Newtons (N)


# Requirements

Python 3.x

No Python and external libraries required (only Python built-in functionality)

Notes
These programs are intended for educational purposes.
Realistic input values (e.g. microcoulombs, astronomical distances) can lead to very large or very small forces.
Floating-point arithmetic is used, so results may contain many decimal places.

#More physics calculation programs may be added to this folder in the future.
