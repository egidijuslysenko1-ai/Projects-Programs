# This is a small Python program designed to help practice linear equations in an interactive way.

The program has two main modes:

Mode A – Compute f(x):
The program generates a random linear equation of the form
f(x) = a·x + b
The user enters a value for x, and the program calculates and displays f(x). program gives random number of variables 2-6. 

Mode D – Solve for x:  
The program generates a linear equation. I used only up to 3 variable (integers + constants) because calculation and checking gets too lengthy if there's more.
a·x + b = y
The user must solve the equation manually and enter the correct value of x.
The program then checks the answer (with tolerance for floating-point precision).

This project was created as math practice combined with beginner Python programming, focusing on:

Linear equations;
Randomized problem generation;
User input and validation;
Control flow (if / elif / else, loops)

Functions and return values
