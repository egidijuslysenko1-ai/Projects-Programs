This program is a visualization tool for Gaussian filtering, commonly used in image processing and signal processing.
It demonstrates how a Gaussian filter and others smooth out data by reducing noise and high-frequency variations. The script generates data (or processes provided data) and visually compares the original signal/image with the Gaussian-filtered result. Also creates a pipeline of a other filter combination.

The goal of this program is educational:
To understand how Gaussian filters work
To visualize the effect of smoothing
To connect mathematical concepts with practical applications

What the Program Does
Applies a Gaussian filter to data
Visualizes results using plots
Helps build intuition for filtering, smoothing, and noise reduction

Libraries Required
This program uses the following Python libraries:

numpy – numerical calculations
matplotlib – plotting and visualization
scipy – Gaussian filtering functions

Installation
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
